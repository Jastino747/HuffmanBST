# HuffmanBST
A simple Huffman Binary Search Tree program, capable to arrange a Huffman Binary Search Tree according to your text input, and also arrange the binary code from the input. You can also decode the binary code from the formed tree, into the alphabetical text. This program was made for a simple project, for the data structure university course.

This program was built with Visual Studio 2017 Community, with .NET Framework. Some of the instructions in program, were instructed in Bahasa.

Take a peek at the "HuffmanBST" folder, for the project's source code. If you want to test the result only, simply run the .exe file inside the "0. Output" folder, use the .docx file for input text example, and have fun :)
